HOW TO BUILD A FIRMWARE FOR THE BROADCOM BCM963XX GT784WN NCS DSL MODEM/ROUTER

Warning!! These instructions do not build a fully functional modem/router. You will need to add a way to access the device 
into the code, before compiling it. (i.e. SSH, Telnet, or some type of GUI)

These Instructions Explain:
 
 * How to install the BCM963xx GPL source code onto the Linux workstation 
 * How to build the image file for the Actiontec GT784WN NCS 
 * How to upgrade the device using the new firmware image file. 
 * How to recover the device to the original firmware. 

NOTE: The following procedures are known to work with Fedora 9. 

The Actiontec GT784WN Source Code can be obtained from the Actiontec support website at http://opensource.actiontec.com.


1. INSTALL THE BCM963XX 4.06L.02 CONSUMER RELEASE GT784WN NCS.

$ su
                    (open a console window and login as "su")

# mkdir /tmp/consumer
                    (create a temp directory to install the source to)

# cp bcm963xx_4.06L.02_consumer_release_GT784WN_NCS.tar.gz /tmp/consumer  
                    (copy source code to temp directory)

# cd /tmp/consumer
                    (make /tmp/consumer the working directory)

# tar xvfz bcm963xx_4.06L.02_consumer_release_GT784WN_NCS.tar.gz
                    (decompress and extract the files so they can be installed)

# ./consumer_install
                    (install the source code and software tools)



2. BUILD THE DESIRED IMAGE.

# cd /tmp/consumer/bcm963xx_router
                    (make /tmp/consumer/bcm963xx_router the working directory)

# make PROFILE=96328GW
                    (running this "make" command will build the firmware image)


YOU CAN UPLOAD THE IMAGE TO THE ROUTER BY FOLLOWING THESE STEPS.

1. Use a Web browser to access the GT784WN NCS at it's LAN IP Address

2. Navigate to the "Firmware Upgrade" page

3. Use the Browse button to locate the newly created image file
       (It will be in the /tmp/consumer/bcm963xx_router/images directory)

4. Click the button to upgrade the Firmware

5. Once the GUI says the upgrade has completed successfully, reboot the device to load the new firmware image. 

6. Now the modem/router will be ready for you to access it with the method that you included before compiling the image.  



YOU CAN RECOVER THE ROUTER BY FOLLOWING THESE STEPS.

1.	Connect an Ethernet cable from your computer to the router.

2.	Set a static IP of 192.168.1.x with a default gateway of 192.168.1.1 to your NIC.

3.	Power off your router.

4.	Find a pen or something small that will fit into the reset button hole on the back of the unit.

5.	Push and hold that reset button in and power on the unit.

6.	Wait for the power light to go red.

7.	Release the reset button.

8.	Open your web browser and go to the IP address of 192.168.1.1 you should get a screen that will give you instructions 
    on how to load the original firmware image to the router.
